# Squares Mini Project

- Create a React w/ Redux application written in TypeScript or JavaScript.
- The application initially displays a colored rectangle which, when clicked, splits into four smaller rectangles colored differently.
- The same behavior is applicable for each of the smaller rectangles to an indefinite level.
- The state of the application should be preserved upon page refresh.
- The application should also support undo/redo through keyboard shortcuts and through two buttons which will be disabled if corresponding undo/redo actions are not available.
- There should also be a reset button which reverts the application to the single rectangle state.

## STEPS

- Create Square component
- Create color generator logic
- Create square splitter logic
- Create Redux store
- Create Redux actions
- Create reset logic
- Create undo logic
